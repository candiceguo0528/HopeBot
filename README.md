# HopeBot
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by the GPT-3.5 Turbo, is aimed at preliminary depression screening. To test HopeBot's abilities, we created 10 unique characters reflecting different genders, ages, mental states, and levels of depression from young to old. 20 participants were recruited to browse the chat transcript and complete questionnaires.

The study received approval from the Institute of Health Informatics Low-Risk Ethics Committee at University College London (Approval Number: 13-IHIREC). Before participating in the study, all participants provided their written consent by signing the Participant Information Form and the Consent Form.

Selection Process:

To ensure equal representation of all chat transcripts in the selection process, we divided participants into 4 groups of 5. Within each group, participants randomly drew lots to determine the order in which they would select their chat transcripts. The participant in each group would select two chats, which were then removed from the pool, ensuring they were not available for subsequent participants in the same group. This process was repeated until all participants had selected their chat transcripts, guaranteeing that each chat transcript was reviewed without repetition within the groups.
